After Henry took the throne at age 17, six weeks later he married Catherine of Aragon. She was previously married to Henry Brother however he died a few months later. 


Her and Henry where married for 24 years, where they had a girl named Mary. 


However not long after Henry became fustrated with the lack of male heir which caused his eyes to wander. 


During their marriage he had an affair with one of Catherine ladies in waiting. She gave birth to Henry Fitzroy which was Henry's only acknowleged illegitimate child. 
 

In 1520, Henry had developed feelings for Anne Boelyn, another lady in waiting to Catherine, which caused him to seek the Pope approval of annulment which was ultimately declined. He decided to divorce Catherine agaisnt the will of the roman catholic church establishing the church of england.

<br> 

After Henry broke away from the roman catholic church him and Anne married in January of 1533. Anne gave birth to their first child Elizabeth, in september of that same year
year. 

<br>


Just like Catherine of Aragon, Anne wasn't able to give him a son which made him start to lose interest in her. Later he took a mistress which made Anne enraged. Her sister in law was banished from court on one occasion when she and Anne had plotted to remove the mistress from court. 

<br>

Henry was desperate to end the relationship which caused him to acuse Anne of adultery and treason which caused the marriage to be anulled. 

<br>
On May 19, 1536 Anne was beheaded for these accused crimes which were most likely not true.

Anne Boelyn and Jane Seymor mothers were first cousins who shared the same grandmother. Both Anne Boelyn and Jane Seymour came to blow in more than one occasion in court. As Henry attraction grew for Jane Seymour.
