# The Vampire diaries 
<br>
<hr>



One of the moments I remember the most from my early teenage years was watching the show The Vampire Diaries, which I loved. 

This show ran for 8 seasons with 22 episodes per season. Watching it was like transferring to a different world where everything was magical, from vampires, werewolves, and witches to mixed creatures like hybrids and heretics. Not only that, but this show also introduced the original, which were the oldest and first vampires to roam the earth. In this blog, I will give you a breakdown of each season of the vampire diaries.
