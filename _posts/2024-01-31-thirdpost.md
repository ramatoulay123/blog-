# The Vampire diaries

<hr>



From my early teenage years one of the moments I remember the most was watching the show The vampire diaries which I loved. 

This show ran for 8 seasons with 22 episodes per season. Watching this was like transferring to a different world where everything was magical from vampire, werewolves, and witches to even mixed creatures like hybrids and heretics. Not only that but this show also introduced the originals which were the oldest and first vampires to roam the earth. In this blog I will give you a breakdown of each season of the vampire diaries.
